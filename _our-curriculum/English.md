#### Vision

Every student of North Vista Primary School will be engaged 21st century EL learner who is an empathetic communicator, discerning reader and creative inquirer. 

#### Key Programmes

##### **1. STELLAR 2.0 Programme**
We adopt the STELLAR 2.0 approach in the teaching and learning of the English Language. Students are immersed in language learning as they are exposed to various age-appropriate genres of reading texts. The core features of our EL classrooms include STELLAR (Strategies for the Teaching of English Language and Reading), shared book approach, explicit teaching of vocabulary and grammar, modified language experience approach, word study lessons, differentiated-focused lessons and extensive reading. 

##### **2. Support Programmes**
The Learning Support Programme (LSP), School Dyslexia Remediation Programme (SDR) and Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) provide interventions for students with reading difficulties. Specially trained instructors conduct targeted and focused lessons to level up students in their phonemic awareness and reading comprehension skills.


##### **3. Storyboard Character Day**
With the overarching aim of nurturing the joy of reading in students, Storybook Character Day is held annually to bring the characters (of books) to life. With a series of activities and lessons leading up to the actual day, both teachers and students will come dressed up in their favourite characters to showcase the range of characters in the reading world.
