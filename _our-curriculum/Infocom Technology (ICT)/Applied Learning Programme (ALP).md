### Applied Learning Programme (ALP)

#### Objectives
* To provide opportunities for students to construct and make meaning from different areas of learning and critically apply knowledge and create solutions to address real world issues.
* To enable students to acquire skills like collaboration, communication and problem-solving (through computational thinking) to prepare them for the complexities and challenges faced in this digital age.

#### Programme Overview
Students are introduced to Scratch Junior, an age-appropriate block-based programming in Primary 1 and 2. In block-based programming, computer instructions are represented as blocks of code. The students simply drag and drop these blocks of code to form a program. After learning basic coding concepts, they design their digital storyboards to promote awareness on environmental conservation.
