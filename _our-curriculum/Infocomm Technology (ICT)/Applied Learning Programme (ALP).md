Play. Create. Share @ North Vista Primary School strives to nurture the students as future-ready problem solvers through authentic real-world applications. To develop the students as critical thinkers and expressive communicators, they learn through play, co-create prototypes and share to their peers. <br><br>

Primary 1 to Primary 4 students learn about computational thinking and collaborate to create their digital storyboards based on environmental sustainability. <br><br>

Primary 5 students learn about design thinking to provide solutions for their community problems. Their prototypes range from creating a wallet for the visually impaired using Braille to a modified clipboard that students can use for their learning excursion. <br><br>

Students from Infocomm and Innovation Club apply their knowledge and create solutions for their challenges. Innovation students explore with strawbees and STEM activities to develop their creativity and critical thinking. Infocomm students designed and created a prototype pet hamster that aims to support mental wellness and empower mental health among the students during the COVID-19 pandemic for Pei Hwa Virtual Hackathon. The team lived up to expectations and emerged as 1st runner up. For 3D-Tronics Challenge, the team’s project idea and video shown on the social media were well-liked by the public and thus, was awarded ‘The Influencer Award’. Infocomm students performed well in the Bebras Computational Thinking Challenge and DrCT Competition where they apply computational thinking methodology to develop solutions.
