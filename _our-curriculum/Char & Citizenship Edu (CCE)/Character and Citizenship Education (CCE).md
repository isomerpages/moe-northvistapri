#### Vision
To equip each Vistalite with the values, skills and attitudes to be a caring leader.

#### Vista Values Education
As part of North Vista Primary School’s character development program, our Vistalites take part in weekly assembly talks on values. Through story-telling, skits, videos and lessons, values are inculcated in our Vistalites who are given opportunities to demonstrate them through other platforms such as Catch Them Doing Right and our Values in Action projects.

#### Peer Support

The Peer Support structure in North Vista Primary School (NVTPS) is known as the **Vista Rainbow Bridge**. It reaches out to the students who need help and add colours to their school life in NVTPS.

**Objectives**<br>
* To cultivate strong and caring peer relationships in the school
* To help students to identify their social circle of support, and recognise signs of distress
* To facilitate students to seek help by alerting trusted school personnel when their friends encounter difficulties
<br>

**Vista Bears** <br>
Students from various levels are trained to be Peer Support Leaders a.k.a. Vista Bears yearly.

Their roles are in the acronyms of **B.E.A.R .**<br><br>
**B**e a friend to all classmates and model “inclusiveness” to the rest to follow. <br>
**E**ncourage classmates to seek help from teachers, AED and counsellor when in distress<br>
**A**lert to FTs/Mama Papa Bears of students who show signs of distress and change of behavior<br>    **R**eady to help, listen and support classmates in a non-judgmental way.

**Vista Care Corner** <br>
Our school has a Vista Care Corner for students to visit during recess, to play and bond with their Vista Bears. It is a safe corner for them to confide in their class Vista Bears.

**Vista Buddies**<br>
With the vision of “Everyone has a friend in NVTPS”, each student has a Vista Buddy in the class. Vista Buddies will help each other, especially when one buddy is absent from school. He/she is responsible to inform his/her buddy of what happened in school and what assignments her buddy has missed during his/her absence. They will know more about each other and show appreciations to each other on Vista Care Day, i.e. week 5 of each term.

On top of that, as Vista Buddies, each P4 student is assigned to take care one to two P1 students at the start of each school year.
