#### Vision
To equip each Vistalite with the values, skills and attitudes to be a caring leader.

#### Vista Values Education
As part of North Vista Primary School’s character development program, our Vistalites take part in weekly assembly talks on values. Through story-telling, skits, videos and lessons, values are inculcated in our Vistalites who are given opportunities to demonstrate them through other platforms such as Catch Them Doing Right and our Values in Action projects.
