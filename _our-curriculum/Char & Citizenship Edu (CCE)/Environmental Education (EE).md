<h4>Objective</h4>
<p>To instill a greater sense of awareness of global environmental issues
so that the students take personal ownership towards the environment. Students
will know more about environmental problems such as food waste, climate
change, deforestation, pollution and mass extinction of species.</p>
<h4>Green with NV: Our Environmental Initiatives</h4>
<p>At North Vista Primary School, we are committed to fostering environmental
responsibility through engaging and meaningful initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Recycling Right</strong>
</p>
<p>Our <strong>Recycling Right</strong> programme encourages students to develop
daily recycling habits. Each classroom has a dedicated Recycling Corner
where students sort recyclables, while Eco Rangers take the lead in promoting
sustainability. Interactive lessons on the Student Learning Space (SLS)
teach proper recycling practices through activities and quizzes. A school-wide
recycling competition further motivates students, with efforts tracked
and recognised.</p>

<p><strong>Fruit Peel Campaign</strong>
</p>
<p>The <strong>Fruit Peel Campaign</strong> promotes composting by encouraging
students and staff to collect fruit peels, which are then turned into nutrient-rich
compost for the school garden. This initiative teaches waste reduction
and allows the school community to witness how organic waste benefits plant
growth. Compost is also distributed during school events.</p>

<p><strong>Farm to Table</strong>
</p>
<p>Through the <strong>Farm to Table</strong> initiative, Primary 4 students
learn about sustainable farming by growing vegetables using hydroponics.
They gain hands-on experience planting, observing, and harvesting crops,
which are later used in canteen meals—helping them see the full cycle of
food production.</p>

<p><strong>Energy Wise</strong>
</p>
<p>Our <strong>Energy Wise</strong> programme instills good energy-saving habits.
Eco Rangers in each class ensure lights, fans, and devices are switched
off when not in use. Students track their class’s energy conservation efforts,
with a two-tier monitoring system to verify progress. Classes that consistently
practise energy-saving habits are recognised and rewarded, reinforcing
the importance of collective responsibility.</p>
<p>These initiatives empower our students to take an active role in sustainability,
equipping them with lifelong eco-friendly habits that make a difference!</p>
