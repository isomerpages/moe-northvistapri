#### Vision
Equipping our children with Skills, Dispositions, and Knowledge for a fast-changing and globalised future.

#### Objective
Students will
*   Exhibit confidence in what they do and express themselves effectively
*   Exhibit curiosity and positive attitudes to learn
*   Enjoy group experiences and teamwork

#### Programme Overview
PAL provides a broad exposure of experiences to our students in the 4 domains: Sport & Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts and Visual Arts. It offers a balance between the academic and non-academic areas in the school, and facilitates holistic and well-rounded development of the pupils.

With Primary 1 and 2 students in mind, PAL emphasises learning through hands-on experiences, having fun and enjoyment in the learning, and ongoing opportunities for peer interaction and self-discovery.

In PAL lessons, your child will be actively participating in a range of activities in subject areas such as music, dance, art, sports, games, and the outdoors. Opportunities will be given for him/her to work individually and with others, create and express his/her thoughts and feelings, make decisions, and reflect on his/her experiences and learning.

The experiences will help your child develop a greater awareness of himself and his environment. He/she will discover new interests, learn new skills, forge new friendships, and develop his /her confidence and character.
