### General Information for Parents/Guardians

####   1\. Access to The School

We want to keep our school safe for our students. All visitors/parents must register their presence at the Security Post at the front gate and obtain a Visitor Sticker. The sticker is valid for visiting the school bookshop and General Office only. The Visitor Sticker shall be worn within the school premises for easy identification by staff and students. 

Nobody is allowed to access any other parts of the school premises without prior permission from the General Office.

#### 2\. Morning Drop-Off & Vehicle Decal

Parents who drive students to school will be allowed to drop them off along the sheltered walkway within school grounds until   7.25 a.m. Parents should not alight or park their car within the school grounds as parking lots are reserved for season parking only. Please adhere strictly to the school regulations of not driving more than 15 km/h within the school grounds. Exhibit greater care and patience while driving in the school premises.

Students who walk to school should enter the school via the sheltered walkway/Side Gate 1/Side Gate 3 to the bistro,  and should not take a shortcut across the car park.

#### 3\. Safety Around The School

Students entering the school should walk along the designated walkway provided (_See Safe Route to School below_). Students should queue when buying food in the Bistro and when they are boarding their respective school buses. Students should also use the school facilities in the way they are intended for, and exercise care and caution at all times. All students should walk quietly around the school. When the lightning risk alert system is activated, students should stay indoors and avoid all outdoor activities.

#### 4\. School Dismissal

All students can be dismissed via the Main Gate, Side Gate 3 (near Bistro) or Side Gate 7 (near ISH). Parents should work out an agreed meeting point with their children. For the safety of all students, parents should wait at the designated void decks of the  HDB flats so as to avoid congestion at the gates. Parents who are driving into the school to pick up their children can do so only after 1.45 p.m. or when all our school buses have left. Students should be waiting for their parents at the drop off point at Block A.

On CCA days, parents/caregivers will pick the students from the main gate. They may wait at the Security Post but will not be permitted to wait at the Bistro. For those who are driving, they may pick up their children from the Security Post or drive in only at  4 p.m. to pick up the students from drop off point at Block A. Parents should not alight and loiter in the Bistro or school grounds.


#### 5\. Outside the School  

Students are to use the pedestrian crossing and obey traffic signals. They are to exercise care and caution when crossing the road,

such as always look right, look left, look right again and raise the right hand before crossing the road.
