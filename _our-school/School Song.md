### School Song

From far and near we have come <br>
Our hearts and minds to be inspired <br>
A family of learners <br>
United in love and purpose. <br>

In all we strive to do our best <br>
Through challenges we build character <br>
Our talents take flight <br>
Together we shine like starlight. <br>

Highest in Love, Utmost in Deed. <br>
Noblest in Aspiration, Excellence in Spirit <br>
Highest in Love, Utmost in Deed <br>
Noblest in Aspiration <br>
North Vista, shine forth! <br>
Noblest in Aspiration <br>
North Vista, shine forth! <br>
