Though relatively young, the school has done fairly well not only in the academics but also in the aesthetics and sports domains.  The school is known for nurturing players talented in Rugby and Softball and consistently performs well in Choir, Band, and in the Chinese and International Dances at the SYF Presentations.

Mr. Phua Kia Wang, the founding Principal has set the initial directions for the school and Mrs. Dhillon A. Singh has further initiated and made changes to align with the school profile and changes in the education landscape. My goal as the next Principal is to build upon the good work done and work collaboratively with the staff and key stakeholders to bring the school to the next stage of development. With its mission “Build Character, Inspire Passion in Learning”, the school is poised to nurture Vistalites who are prepared with the requisite knowledge and skillsets to access the many pathways open to them in their next educational journey.

With the setup of the MOE Kindergarten, we hope to provide a seamless K-6 education experience for our students in North Vista. Together with the continued strong support of the school community, we can realize our vision of building a Community of Learners who are:

* **Self-directed Learners**
* **Gracious and Confident Learners**
* **Tech-savvy Creators**
* **Balanced Individuals**
