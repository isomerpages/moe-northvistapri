<p>Tchoukball offers the students an opportunity to develop teamwork, coordination
and sportsmanship in a supportive setting. As a Territorial &amp; Invasion
sport, it allows students to focus on fundamental skills and game strategies
in game contexts.</p>
<p>Through structured drills and modified games, students experience cooperative
play with light competitive elements. The activity suits all skill levels,
as the coaches tailor the programme to build confidence and social connections
among the students.</p>
<p>This CCA promotes an active lifestyle and emphasizes on participation
and personal progress over winning. Students learn to work together while
enjoying a unique team sport.</p>
