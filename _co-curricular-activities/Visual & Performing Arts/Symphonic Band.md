### Symphonic Band

Our objective is to nurture the musical talents of our Band members and through working as a team, to cultivate in them the values such as Respect, Resilience, Responsibility, Integrity, Care and Harmony.

#### Recruits
Our recruits form the future backbone of Vista Concert Band. Therefore, the focus of Recruits CCA sessions is to lay strong foundation. This includes learning the correct sitting posture, proper breathing techniques, embouchure, way to hold the instruments and tone production.

#### Junior & Main Band
Recruits who have successfully completed 1 year of foundational training will be promoted to Junior Band. In the Junior Band, members get to stretch their playing skills. They will also get the opportunities to join the Main Band to hone their listening and performance skills, technical precision and learn to work as a team.

#### Celebration Night
Celebration Night celebrates the progress and personal milestones that the Band members have achieved over the year.

Parents will be invited to listen to the mini repertoire prepared by our members. All our stakeholders will also bond over the sumptuous spread contributed by our parents.

#### Band Camp
During the school holidays, our band members get the chance to join band members from other schools in a Combined School Band Camp. This day camp enables our band members to be trained under the tutelage of other band instructors and gain the experience of playing in a 120-strong band.

#### CCA Schedule
Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays. Schedule will be sent to parents via Parents Gateway before the start of a new semester.
