The Vista Concert Band seeks to nurture students' musical talents while fostering key values such as Respect, Resilience, Responsibility, Integrity, Care, and Harmony. By engaging in music-making and band activities, we aim to build up students' 21st Century Competencies (21CC), strengthening their skills and dispositions to succeed both in school and in their future endeavours.

#### Recruits (P2s)
Our recruits are the future of the Vista Concert Band. During their first year, the focus is on building a strong foundation, covering essential skills like correct posture, breathing techniques, embouchure, instrument handling, and tone production.

#### Junior & Main Band (P3s - P6s)
After completing foundational training, recruits advance to the Junior Band, where they further refine their playing abilities. Junior Band members also have the opportunity to join the Main Band, where they develop advanced performance techniques, teamwork, and listening skills through ensemble playing.

#### Band Exchanges and Performances
Band members regularly take part in band exchanges and performances both within and outside the school, offering them diverse opportunities to collaborate with other musicians and showcase their talents.

#### Encouraging Instrument Borrowing for Self-Practise
o support students’ continuous growth, we encourage borrowing instruments for self-practise at home. Self-practise helps students strengthen their technical abilities, build discipline, and deepen their musical understanding. Parents need to fill out and sign an indemnity form for instrument borrowing, ensuring proper care of the school’s instruments.
