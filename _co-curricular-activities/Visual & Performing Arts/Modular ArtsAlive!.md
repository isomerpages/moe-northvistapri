<p>Modular ArtsALIVE! is a vibrant CCA designed to give students broad exposure
to both the performing and visual arts. Unlike traditional CCAs with a
single focus, ArtsALIVE! offers a series of short-term modules throughout
the year, allowing students to explore various art forms and discover their
interests. This approach supports holistic development by encouraging creativity,
self-directed learning, and the appreciation of diverse perspectives.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through active participation, students also develop important values such
as empathy, respect, and teamwork. ArtsALIVE! is ideal for students who
enjoy creative expression and are keen to grow both artistically and personally..</p>
