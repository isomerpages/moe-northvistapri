Founded in 2013, the Choir was established with the mission of nurturing a love for music while empowering choristers to pursue excellence in their vocal and musical development. United by a shared passion for singing, the Choir aims to inspire, uplift, and bring joy to audiences through heartfelt and expressive performances.

The Choir is composed of two main divisions: the Junior Choir and the Senior Choir, providing age-appropriate training and performance opportunities for choristers at different stages of their musical journey. The Choir places great importance on regular attendance and discipline, as they are essential to the growth and success of each chorister and the Choir as a whole.
