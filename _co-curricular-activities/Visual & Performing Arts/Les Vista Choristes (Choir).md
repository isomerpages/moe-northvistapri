Les Vista Choristes was formed in 2013 with the mission to help choristers pursue excellence through their passion in music. The choir’s motto is “We Sing. We Inspire. We Bring Joy.” Through their singing, the choir hopes to inspire and bring joy to people around them.

Les Vista Choristes consists of the Junior and Senior choir. Selection is mainly through audition and by invitation.

#### Values In Action
Living by our motto “We Sing. We Inspire. We Bring Joy”, our choristers aspire to inspire and bring joy to the community through their voices. Les Vista Choristes’ adopted charity is Grace Lodge Nursing Home and the choir has been visiting the residents regularly to share their care and music.


#### CCA Schedule
