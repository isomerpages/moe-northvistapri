#### Vision
Enabling young people to be active citizens creating positive change in their communities and in the world based on shared values.

#### Mission of Scouting
To contribute to the education of young people, through the value system based on the Scout Promise and Law, to help build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society.

#### Overview
Our sessions are targeted to develop our cub scouts into independent individuals through games and outdoor activities. These activities will provide them knowledge of basic Scouting skills such as knotting and pitching of tents. At the end of these activities, they will earn badges as a proof of their accomplishments.

#### Key Programmes

**\* Job Week**<br>
Job Week is an annual educational experience for all Scouts. The main purpose of the Job Week is to inculcate in Scouts the dignity of labour and the value of honest work and to help others. These values are important to develop them to be better citizens of the 21st Century and is an integral part of the Scout Programme.

**\*Sixer Training Camp**<br>
A leadership camp aimed at training exemplary cub scouts so that they can fulfil their appointed sixer or assistant sixer duties ably and confidently once they return to their unit.

 _\*New recruits (also known as Tenderfoots) will not be required to buy their uniform as they will be under a trial period to allow the child to see if they like scouting. After a few months, once the Tenderfoot has earned his/ her World Scout badge and uniform, an investiture ceremony will be held and the Tenderfoot will be promoted to a Cub Scout._
