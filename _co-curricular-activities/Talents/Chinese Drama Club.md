Chinese Language (CL) Drama was set up in 2018 to offer more performing arts options to our students. Our team comprises of students from the P2 to P6 cohort.

CL Drama is open to all students who are interested. It offers students the opportunities to learn performing techniques in drama and speech presentation in Mandarin. Through this CCA, students learn the basic skills and techniques of acting, storytelling and speech presentation.

Students may be shortlisted to represent the school in story-telling and speech competitions. They will also be given opportunities to perform in drama for school performances.

#### CCA Schedule
Every Monday. Schedule will be sent to parents via Parents Gateway before the start of a new term/semester.
