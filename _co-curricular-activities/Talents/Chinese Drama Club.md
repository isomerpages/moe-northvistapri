Chinese Language Drama develops students' acting skills, stage presence, and appreciation for the performing arts. Through regular training and stage opportunities, students learn to express themselves with clarity and emotion, both verbally and non-verbally, while building confidence in using the Chinese language.

Participation in this CCA also nurtures students’ holistic development. As students work together to rehearse and perform, they develop essential life skills such as creativity, teamwork, and communication. They also become more self-aware and mindful of their tone, body language, and expressions, which helps them grow into confident, expressive individuals both on and off stage.


#### CCA Schedule
Every Monday. Schedule will be sent to parents via Parents Gateway before the start of a new term/semester.
