English Drama provides students with a platform to develop communication skills, creativity, and self-expression. Through guided activities and script work, students explore storytelling, vocal projection, and stage presence in a supportive environment.

The CCA prepares students for the Singapore Youth Festival (Drama) competition which paves the pathway for those considering Direct School Admission opportunities to the secondary school of their choice. Structured rehearsals and performance experiences help participants build confidence, teamwork, and artistic appreciation.
