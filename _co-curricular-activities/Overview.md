The 3P Programme is a co-curricular activity framework that provides students with opportunities to construct knowledge through a broad range of meaningful experiences and various platforms. The programme aims to provide students with participation and/or competition opportunities. It is designed with the objective of creating an environment that advocates the holistic development of our students. The acronym VISTA was adopted where the CCA Activities are broadly categorised into Visual & Performing Arts, ICT, Sports Talents & Adventure(VISTA).

At the end of Primary 2, students will be able to choose from ICT & Scholastic Clubs, Uniform Groups as well as the Modular CCAs. An option form will be made available at the end of Primary 2 and students will be encouraged to participate in that CCA until they graduate.

PE, Art & Music teachers will make recommendations to parents based on their day-to-day observations of the students for the Visual, Performing Arts and Sports CCAs. Modular CCAs are experiential in nature and exposes students to different Sports or Visual & Performing Arts in a modular format.
