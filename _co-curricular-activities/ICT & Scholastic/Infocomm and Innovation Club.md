The Infocomm & Innovation Club is dedicated to fostering design thinking amongst students. Through hands-on prototyping experiences, students develop coding skills whilst cultivating their creative abilities. Our CCA offers an engaging platform where students can build emerging 21st Century Competencies needed to thrive in today's rapidly changing digital world.


Students explore the world of digital making by working with coding interfaces such as Scratch, Micro:bit, and Thunkable. These platforms enable them to design, prototype, and transform their ideas into tangible creations. Through engaging sessions, students build problem-solving, product design, and prototyping skills to tackle real-world challenges.


The club also offers opportunities to experiment with cutting-edge technology like VR goggles, immersing students in innovative projects that integrate coding and advanced tools, unlocking new horizons in digital innovation.
Committed to fostering confidence and creativity, the club inspires students to develop impactful solutions for everyday problems. From designing interactive games to creating apps and prototypes, members are encouraged to think critically, explore boldly, and bring their ideas to life.


For those passionate about technology or curious about the endless possibilities of digital creation, the Infocomm & Innovation Club is the perfect place to learn, grow, and innovate.
