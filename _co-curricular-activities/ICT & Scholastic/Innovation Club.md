### Innovation Club

Innovation Club was set up to provide students a platform to think out of the box. The hands-on activities that we conduct promote innovation, creativity and engagement. Students also infuse knowledge and skills from various fields such as engineering and science. We aim to promote a culture of innovation and a conducive environment for generation of ideas.

Innovation Club is basically time for FUN BRAINWORK!

In this programme, we delve deeper into the design thinking process and nurture the members to be problem solvers. Through an intense and hands-on 15 sessions programme, members are facilitated to create a product of their own to solve a social issue. They will present their products during the annual Innovation Fair.

Club members will also be engaged in a slew of hands-on challenges such as: Catapult Launch, Tallest Tower, DIY Marble Run (out of cardboard).
