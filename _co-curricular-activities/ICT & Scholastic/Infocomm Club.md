Infocomm Club aims to develop students’ interest in infocomm by allowing them to learn new infocomm skills in a fun and meaningful way. The programme focuses on nurturing students as creative and critical problem-solvers. We provide platforms for students to deepen their learning in coding as digital makers. Students will apply their problem solving skills to solve real world problems. Selected students will be given opportunities to take part in annual national competitions such as National Primary Games Creation Competition (NPGCC) and Pei Hwa Hackathon.

#### CCA Schedule
Mondays. Schedule will be sent to parents via Parents Gateway before the start of a new semester.
