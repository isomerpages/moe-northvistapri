We are a group of teachers and students who loves Science and enjoys exploring the different aspects of Science. We plant and harvest our own in-house hydroponics crops, make Science toys and conduct experiments to verify different Science theories and hypothesis.

The team is focused in training for National Science competitions such as Singapore Youth Science Fair, Elementz and Science Buskers.

The Environment Club aims to deepen students’ understanding and awareness of environmental issues and cultivate a pro-environment mindset amongst the club members.

Through hands-on learning experiences, students will have opportunities to carry out projects on environmental issues. Students will also help to share environmental messages through morning assembly or run programmes to promote awareness in environmental issues.

Some of the themes that students will explore include recycling, reducing food waste and gardening.

Students will learn to work in teams and build on their confidence, communication skills and values such as respect, resilience and care.
