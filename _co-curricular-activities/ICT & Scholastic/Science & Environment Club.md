The Science and Environment Club brings together teachers and students who enjoy exploring the wonders of Science and caring for the environment. We grow hydroponic crops, build Science toys, and conduct fun hands-on experiments to explore scientific concepts.

The club nurtures curiosity and a love for Science, while promoting awareness of environmental issues. Through projects and campaigns, students learn to advocate for a greener future.

Themes include scientific investigations through fun activities, recycling, reducing food waste, and gardening. Along the way, students develop teamwork, confidence, communication, and values such as respect, resilience, and care.
