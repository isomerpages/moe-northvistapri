<h4>PSG@Vista Regular Duties</h4>
<p>We support the school through various programmes such as the ‘Bistro Angels@Vista’
where parent volunteers patrol the school during recess breaks to ensure
discipline and safety of the Vistalites.&nbsp; Another avenue where parents
contribute is through the ‘Reading Parents Programme’ where parents read
to students in the Primary 1 and 2 Learning Support Programme.</p>
<h4>PSG@Vista Events and Collaboration</h4>
<p>Some events that our parent volunteers are involved in include ‘Science
Eureka Week’ and ‘Maths is Fun’ recess activities. We render our support
to the school by performing and facilitating in school celebrations and
events such as Racial Harmony Day and Children’s Day.</p>
<p>We also co-organise events such as Tea Appreciation and Family Day to
promote close relationships between school, parents and children. We actively
support FamilyMatters@School and the Dads for Life movement, which organize
workshops and events for parents to equip them with skills to nurture positive
family relations.</p>
