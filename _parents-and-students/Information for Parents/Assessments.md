The school conducts both formative and summative assessments. Formative assessments are used mainly for diagnostic purposes. These assessments help students identify their weaknesses and improve on their learning. Summative assessments measure the level of success that is obtained at the end of a unit or at the end of a semester.


**1. Assessment Overview**

The following table summarises the assessments and their weightings.



| Level | Term 1 | Term 2 | Term 3 | Term 4  |

**2. Absence from Examinations**

All students must be punctual for the examinations. Students who are unwell should rest at home and not sit for the assessments. They should see a doctor to obtain a Medical Certificate (MC). The assessment results for students who are absent during the assessments and covered by MCs will pro-rated accordingly. There will not be any makeup for written examinations. However, for the oral exam, the school will on a case by case basis allow students to sit for the oral exam.

Should a student be absent without a valid reason, zero marks will be awarded.
