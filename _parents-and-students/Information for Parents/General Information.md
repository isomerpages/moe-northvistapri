provided (<em>See Safe Route to School below</em>). Students should queue
when buying food in the Bistro and when they are boarding their respective
school buses. Students should also use the school facilities in the way
they are intended for, and exercise care and caution at all times. All

<h4 id="dismissal">4. School Dismissal</h4>
<p>All students can be dismissed via the Main Gate, Side Gate 3 (near Bistro)
or Side Gate 7 (near ISH). Parents should work out an agreed meeting point
with their children. For the safety of all students, parents should wait
at the designated void decks of the&nbsp; HDB flats so as to avoid congestion
at the gates. Parents who are driving into the school to pick up their
children can do so only after 1.45 p.m. or when all our school buses have
left. Students should be waiting for their parents at the drop off point
at Block A.</p>
<p>On CCA days, parents/caregivers will pick the students from the main gate.
They may wait at the Security Post but will not be permitted to wait at
the Bistro. For those who are driving, they may pick up their children
from the Security Post or drive in only at&nbsp; 4 p.m. to pick up the
students from drop off point at Block A. Parents should not alight and
loiter in the Bistro or school grounds.</p>

<h4 id="communication">10. Communication with Teachers/School</h4>
<p>If parents need to meet any teacher, they may call and make an appointment,
or leave a note with their children for the teachers. If parents need to
see the teacher without a prior appointment, they can report to the General
Office. Our staff will make the necessary arrangements.</p>
<p>In order not to disrupt curriculum time, parents are encouraged to schedule
appointments with teachers only after school dismissal. With the 5 day
work-week, the school seeks parents’ cooperation in not expecting teachers
to respond to queries after 6.00 p.m. on weekdays and during weekends.</p>
<p>Should parents have any feedback, they may use the following channels
of communication:</p>
