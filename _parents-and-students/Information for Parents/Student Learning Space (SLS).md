[Student Learning Space (SLS)](https://vle.learning.moe.edu.sg/login)&nbsp;is an online learning portal that allows all students to have equal access to quality curriculum-aligned resources. These resources are available to all students for major subjects from primary to pre-university level. In line with the development of 21st Century Competencies (21CC), the SLS encourages learners to be self-directed, and allows them to personalize their learning according to their needs and interests. SLS will be a key platform to support schools in their home-based learning (HBL) measures.
