1. Home-Based Learning (HBL) provides opportunities for students to engage in self-directed learning and serves as an avenue for learning to continue on e-learning days. Lesson packages are prepared by teachers and uploaded online for the students to access from home.


2. Students will complete their online assignments for the respective subjects through the [Student Learning Space(SLS)](https://vle.learning.moe.edu.sg/login). Varieties of assessment modes are included to help the students monitor their own learning. There would be also opportunities for the students to video conference with their subject teachers to seek clarifications in learning via platforms such as Google Meet and Zoom.

3. For technical issues pertaining to the use of the SLS portal such as unlocking accounts and resetting passwords, please refer to the SLS self-help guide or contact the SLS School-based Helpline. Details are found at the school website.

4. The school has a system in place for teachers to monitor students’ learning progress and continue to prepare and deliver lessons. Besides checking on the well-being of the students, teachers also review their learning progress and provide support to help them cope with their learning at home.
