Homework refers to any learning activity that students are required to complete outside of curriculum time. This includes any extension of the classroom work, revision of school work, preparation of lessons, projects and online assignments.

The following table illustrates the guidelines for homework for the different levels:

|  |  |  |
|---|---|---|
| Levels | Weekly Time Norms | Approximate Daily Time Norms |
| P1 & P2 | 3 to 7 hours | 0.5 to 1.0 hours |
| P3 & P4 | 6 to 10 hours | 1.0 to 1.5 hours |
| P5 & P6 | 9 to 13 hours | 1.5 hours to 2.0 hours |
|

Students are to take note of their homework by recording it down in their organizer daily.

To ensure that students benefit from the homework assigned, we would like to seek parents’ cooperation in the following areas:

*   create a home environment conducive for studying and completion of homework;
*   supervise and provide support for child’s learning;
*   reinforce good study habits and attitudes;
*   be mindful of the stresses arising from school homework and out-of-school activities, and help the child prioritize his/her time among these activities; and
*   work in partnership with teachers to support child’s learning and development.
