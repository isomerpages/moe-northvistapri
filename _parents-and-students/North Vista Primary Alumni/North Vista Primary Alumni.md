#### Words from the Alumni Committee ...

_NVTPS has helped me grow in many areas by providing me with a variety of opportunities to pursue my passions and try out new things._

__I am a proud alumnus of the school choir, Les Vista Choristes. My CCA taught me the foundations of music which in part influenced my decision to join the Higher Music Programme in NYGH. It has also given me ample opportunities to perform for public concerts as well as international competitions, which have given me invaluable experiences.__

_When I was in Primary 3, I was selected to be a prefect. In Primary 4, I got a chance to do podium duty, which allowed me to train my public speaking skills and learn to remain calm under pressure. By Primary 6, I got to mentor others which further honed my leadership skills._

_On a whole, I am thankful for the different things I got to do at NVTPS, and I believe these experiences have shaped me to who  I am today. I am grateful to everyone who was involved in my primary school journey and for the chance to give back by serving as an alumnus._

_During the 6 years of my journey in North Vista Primary School, I was exposed to multiple opportunities to help me be a better person._

_I was honored to be a head prefect in NVTPS and it helped me nurture my leadership skills. I also was a scout in Primary School and I learnt some survival skills, discipline and other values._

_The teachers in North Vista Primary School were very interesting to listen to and were willing to go the extra mile to help the students. My classmates also made learning fun during lessons._

_All in all, I will always remember my time in NVTPS and I hope that all students would also have a memorable experience in NVTPS._

_The six years which I spent in North Vista Primary was relished by me as the environment was welcoming and joyous. Not only was learning fun and engaging, but also productive with the exam techniques that are being taught by teachers there. The teachers in North Vista Primary work tirelessly round the clock just to ensure that their students are well prepared for any exams and graded tests. They were also warm and friendly._

_My peers were encouraging, caring and supportive. The classrooms were always neat and tidy as the students were trained to always clean up after themselves. I was also taught to not give up easily whenever I fail. All in all, the school aims to groom all students to become gracious and upright citizens, caring leaders, critical thinkers and healthy individuals._

_I really appreciate my experience and time in NVTPS, giving me different opportunities and valuable memories. They provided much academic and holistic development which from my perspective, proved to be of immense help._

_Firstly, they provided many leadership opportunities for the student leaders to develop their abilities. From holding workshops to letting us lead them, there was one time where I got to lead a leadership workshop along with other students. We were tasked to teach lower primary students about how to be better leaders. I found it really enriching as I came to a realization that I had the ability to empower others within my own capabilities._

_In addition, the teachers had rendered tremendous amounts of assistance during the preparation of the PSLE. They had guided us to excel in our grades and their dedication was evident in how they coordinated remedial lessons for anyone who needed help and was willing to answer any questions we had. They pushed us to our fullest potential._

_All in all, I really did enjoy my time in NVTPS. It plays a huge part in who I am today, from the friends I've made, to the experiences I've gone through._

_North Vista Primary holds my dearest and fond memories of my childhood. It was a place for me to grow, not just as a student, but as a Vistalite, shining bright and overcoming the adversities throughout my primary school journey. As an ex-Vistalite, I was taught to uphold the 6 values of R3ICH – Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Harmony. The teachers were there for us, guiding and showing us the way as we progress from P1 to P6._

_My leadership journey started off in P3, where I was offered the opportunity to be a part of the Vista Student Leader (VSL) community. This was where I realized my passion and drive for being an exemplary leader. As the years went by, I held various leadership positions, such as being a Peer Leader in P4, a Councillor in P5, and a Vice-Head Prefect in P6. I’ve been through a fruitful experience as a leader in North Vista, and that was where my leadership growth just began. _

_As I continuously grew and strived towards excellence as a leader, my journey did not stop there. During my P5 year, I had to opportunity to be part of a Cultural Immersion Trip to Shanghai, China, where we visited the Shanghai Singapore International School and a local school, where I had a fulfilling experience. As we embarked on this trip, I learnt many new skills, especially through my participation in the programmes they provided us with.  _

_Not only does North Vista Primary provide overseas learning opportunities and an insightful leadership journey, I was also provided with numerous workshops and competitions for me to participate in, aiding me in my growth in the diverse areas. There were Mathematics competitions, Speech and Drama workshops, leadership workshops and many more!  _

_North Vista Primary provided me with a space for continual value-adding growth, not just guiding us towards being a Vistalite – to uphold the school values, but also as an exemplary leader. The positive and open learning environment, teachers who constantly guided us, and the people I got to know at North Vista Primary allowed me to learn to the best of my ability. I strongly encourage prospective students to join the Vistalite family for an invaluable 6-year experience! When you fall, don’t remain on the ground. Pick yourself up, understand your mistakes, solve the problems and overcome these difficulties and continue embarking on your journey!  _

_North Vista Primary has been a place that teaches me my moral values and firmly planted my character together with 6 core values Respect, Responsibility, Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care, and Harmony (R3ICH). North Vista Primary has also provided me with many life learning experiences. All this have built me to who I am today. They also have supporting teachers and peers, who have always been by my side whenever I need help, and a listening ear to support me when I am going through problems. I am very grateful to have someone to support me through my 6 years in North Vista Primary._

_I had my first experience as a leader in Primary 2. I was selected to be a prefect, for the next two years we were tested to see whether we were capable to be a prefect. From Primary 4 onwards, I officially became a prefect. This really impacted me as I am able to lead my peers which then other pupils would then eventually become potential leaders like me.  _

_Not only was I able to show my leadership skills by being a prefect. For CCA, I joined softball which was a team sport. Therefore each of us was able to show our leading skills. We had to go through many hard times during competition but with perseverance we got together our team spirit we overcame all difficulties and come out as champions._

_Finally, I would like to thank everyone in north vista who supported me through my 6 years. For everything North Vista Primary has done for me, I have decided to give back to the school by joining NVTPS Alumni. Like what the seven time world champion, Michael Schumacher says “Once there is a passion, the motivation is there.”  _

_North Vista Primary is like a second home to me. It is where I met many amazing teachers and friends. They were caring and supportive, helping us and encouraging us. I would always look forward to going to school all the time to meet my friends and teachers. During my six years journey in North Vista Primary, I had learnt and further honed my skills to be a better version of myself. Our school values known as R3ICH which stood for respect, responsibility, resilience, integrity, care and harmony were taught to us and helped to shape us into our more mature selves._

_In North Vista Primary, I was offered many CCA opportunities. As a member of the Art Club, I had many opportunities to learn new skills and was able to express my emotions and creativity on the artwork I was working on. I was even given a chance to participate in the Singapore Youth Festival and I enjoyed myself along with my fellow CCA mates._

_In addition, I was honored to be a Class Chairperson and Student Leader. In P3, I was nominated to be a prefect. I officially became a prefect in P4 with the rank of Peer Leader. In P5, I was selected to be a Councilor and I became a vice-head prefect in P6. During my time as a student leader, I had experienced many leadership workshops to improve my leadership skills and many different types of morning and afternoon duties such as flag raising duties, announcer duties and recess duties. These made me more confident to speak in front of the whole school as well as become more disciplined. Furthermore, in P6, when I ran for Head Prefect, I learnt to be a more confident leader through the speeches, campaigns and interviews. I had a great deal of fun while running for the position too. Even though I did not manage to become Head Prefect, I was still glad that I was given the chance to experience the campaign._

_To sum it all up, North Vista Primary nurtured me into who I am today. It provided me with a conducive environment for my learning and there was always someone that would look out for me. I would still remember my friend asking if I was alright and comforting me when she saw that I was feeling down. Truly, North Vista Primary would always be a part of me and I would treasure the memories of my time in North Vista Primary. _

_Over the course of my journey at NVTPS, I found it to be a very enriching experience due to the various fields of exposure. The school exposed us to technology at a young age and actively incorporated it into our curriculum, which I found to be especially useful, specifically the computing classes in lower primary. Within classrooms, we also got the chance to learn through platforms such as Koobits, 学乐, etc. This exposure proved to be useful for our journey in the 21st century._

_Moreover, my CCA, choir, provided a multitude of opportunities for us to perform and participate in various venues around Singapore. Training was tough at times, but it would always pay off during show time. Only when I stepped down from choir did I realize the significance and privilege that I had to be able to experience all those valuable opportunities, and I am hence extremely grateful for this._

_Finally, the teachers at NVTPS were proficient in preparing us for the PSLE. During our final year, they put in their best effort to help us excel in the examinations, while ensuring our mental wellbeing at the same time. This was evident in how they purposefully organized the remedial sessions for students who wanted to improve themselves, or how they shared their past students’ experiences in hopes of us doing better. Some teachers seemed strict in our eyes at that time, but we eventually realized that what they did was in fact immensely helpful during that crucial year._

_Overall, my experience at NVTPS was a memorable and valuable one. Aside from the points stated above, the school also shone through other aspects as well, through the provision of learning journeys and enrichment programmes. The friendships and memories forged there have shaped me into who I am today, and will continue to play a role in my life. _

_To future Vistalites: Enjoy and treasure the experiences at NVTPS, for they will truly prove to be of great worth to you in the future._

_North Vista Primary is a place where I have grown to know, a place I hold close to my heart. Not only a school but a second home to me, I was taught to hone many values, such as our core values - Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care, and Harmony (R3ICH). We had our teachers and friends there to support us in times of need, even if it was in Primary 1 or even Primary 6. There was always someone to guide and support us in our primary school journey, and I am always grateful for that. North Vista Primary has given all of us leadership opportunities to learn to be our best selves. For me, my leadership journey started in Primary 1. There were many roles that we could take up in class, like Class Chairperson. I then realised that I was passionate about being a leader, which shaped my 6-year journey in North Vista Primary._

_I was selected to be a Prefect. I officially became one in Primary Four, becoming a Peer Leader. In Primary 5, a student Councillor, and Primary 6, the Head Prefect. All these years, I have been through a significant journey, as I realised what leadership was and how everyone could be leaders in little ways. I learnt that if we put our minds to it, being a prefect doesn’t matter - you don’t need a role to lead._

_Not only this, but North Vista Primary also provides more than leadership opportunities. We embarked on a fruitful voyage as we went on learning journeys, took part in many kinds of competitions, initiated many Values-In-Actions projects, and joined CCAs. We met many people from across the school and bonded with them during sessions._

_I want to thank everyone who has helped me in my six years in North Vista Primary and the teachers who gave me their time, support, and love. For what everyone in North Vista Primary has done to make me who I am today, I took on the role, Chairperson of NVTPS Alumni to express my gratitude and contribute back to the school that holds most of my childhood memories. So join me, fellow alumni, in thanking the ones who have sacrificed their time and spent so much effort in guiding us to where we are today! _

_2016, the year I walked into North Vista as a bright eyed primary 1 student, ready to begin a new chapter of my life. Now, this chapter has come to an end. These past 6 years have been a wonderful journey from which I have grown and learnt every step of the way._

_North Vista taught me the value of resilience from events such as the Primary 5 camp and also by giving me the opportunity to serve the school as the head prefect. The global pandemic was a huge part of my primary 5 and 6 life. But, the school did a great job in taking the necessary measures and precautions, as well as teaching us how to keep ourselves safe. Throughout my entire PSLE period, my teachers and friends gave all the support I needed. All the memories I have made in North Vista will be held close to my heart no matter how old I will grow. No words can express my love and gratitude towards this school. Thank you teachers, school leaders, friends and everyone who made my primary school experience a memorable one._
