<p>At MK@North Vista, we create meaningful and fun experiences for children
throughout the year by celebrating a variety of special events, including
Children’s Day, Parents’ Day, Teacher’s Day, Racial Harmony Day, and cultural
festivals. These celebrations give children opportunities to connect with
their peers, families, and the wider community while nurturing important
values such as respect, care, love, and resilience.</p>
