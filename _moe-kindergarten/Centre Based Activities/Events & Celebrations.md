<p>Each year, we celebrate festivals of the different races we have in Singapore
through fun and engaging activities to expose children to the different
culture. MK@NV, we organise a variety of events to promote connection between
children, families and communities while providing them with opportunities
to nurture values such as respect, love and resilience.</p>
