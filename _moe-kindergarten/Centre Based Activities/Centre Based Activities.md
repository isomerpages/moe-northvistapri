<p>At MK, children engage in meaningful centre-based activities that promote
learning through purposeful play and quality interactions with teachers
and peers.</p>
<p>Children also benefit from child-friendly and engaging outdoor spaces,
including a dedicated MK playground, sand and water play areas, and a sensory
garden, which encourage exploration, creativity, and active learning. In
addition, we organise events and field trips to places of interest to help
children deepen their understanding of the people, places, and experiences
they are learning about in meaningful and engaging ways.</p>
