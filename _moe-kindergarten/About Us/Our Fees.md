<h5><strong><u>Kindergarten Fee Assistance Scheme</u></strong></h5>
<p>(KiFAS) subsidy applies only to MK school fees.</p>
<p>Eligible families with Singapore Citizen children may apply for KiFAS
subsidy, which is provided by the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA),
through MK.</p>
<p>The family needs to meet either the Gross Monthly Household Income (HHI)
or the Gross Monthly Per Capita Income (PCI) criterion.</p>
<p>Your child must attend at least one day of the kindergarten for the month
to qualify for the assistance. Failure to do so will result in the full
kindergarten fee being payable for the month.</p>
