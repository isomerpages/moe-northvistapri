<p>Welcome to MOE Kindergartens (MKs)!</p>
<p>At MKs, we are dedicated to providing your child with a strong start!</p>
<p>Our curriculum is based on the beliefs and principles in the Nurturing
Early Learners (NEL) Framework, that children are joyful, curious, active,
and competent learners. We emphasize on children’s holistic development
through an integrated approach to learning with teachers engaging children
in learning through quality interaction and purposeful play.</p>
