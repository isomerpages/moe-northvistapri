<p>Welcome to MOE Kindergartens (MKs)!</p>
<p>At MKs, we are dedicated to providing your child with a strong start!</p>
<p>Our curriculum is based on the beliefs and principles in the Nurturing
Early Learners (NEL) Framework, that children are joyful, curious, active,
and competent learners. We emphasize on children’s holistic development
through an integrated approach to learning with teachers engaging children
in learning through quality interaction and purposeful play.</p>
<p><strong>Our Focus</strong>
<br>
<br>• The MK curriculum aims to support children holistically, so that they
are confident, demonstrate strong social skills, and have a good foundation
in literacy and numeracy.</p>
<p>• The MK curriculum is designed by MOE curriculum specialists and educators
with knowledge and experience in early childhood education and primary
school curriculum. It emphasizes holistic development of the children through
an integrated approach to teaching and learning.</p>
<p>• Early Childhood Bilingualism: Nurturing early childhood bilingualism
is an important aspect of our curriculum. We seek to nurture early childhood
bilingualism through systematic and explicit teaching of language and early
literacy skills. Children are provided with opportunities to enjoy English
and their Mother Tongue Language (Chinese, Malay or Tamil), communicate
with confidence and be aware of local transitions and customs.</p>
