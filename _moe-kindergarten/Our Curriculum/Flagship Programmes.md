#### Flagship Programmes
The children embark on an exciting learning journey through the two flagship programmes, the HI-Light Programme and Starlight Literacy Programme for English Language (EL) and Mother Tongue Languages (MTL). In addition, the children will also engage in a Weeks of Wonder(WoW) project each term.

#### Centre-based ProgrammesÂ 
Other than the flagship programmes, our Kindergarten has other centre-based programmes that aim to enhance the children's holistic learning and development in the MK.
